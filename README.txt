This repository [https://github.com/utwente-db/DuBio] contains the main 
software for the Dubio project. This project implements a probabilistic
layer on top of Postgres using Binary Decision Diagrams.

+ pgbdd: Our Postgres extension implementing Binary Decision Diagrams (BDD's).
         This is work in progres so do not use it yet:-)

+ examples: some examples of Postgres exension useful for developing
            extensions. The 'mystr' extension implements a very simple string
            type in Postgres covering most important issues implementing
            dynamic Postgres extension types.
