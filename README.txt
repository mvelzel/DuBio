This repository [https://github.com/utwente-db/DuBio] contains the main 
software for the Dubio project. This project tries to implement a i
probabilisticlayer on top of Postgres using Binary Decision Diagrams.

+ examples: some examples of Postgres exension useful for developping
            extensions. The mystr extension impements a very simple string
            type in Postgres covering the most important things you need
            for implementing dynamic types.

+ pgbdd: Our Postgres extension implementing Binary Decision Diagrams (BDD's).
         This is work in progres so do not use it yet:-)
